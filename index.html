        <p>Happy New Year, Spideyyy!❤󰺗</p>
        <p>It’s been 5 months and a week – 160 days, to be exact – since we first met. I know it’s not a long time in the grand scheme of life, yet it feels like we’ve known each other forever. With you, everything felt so normal, so natural, as if it was always meant to be. Nothing was ever awkward, just right.</p>
        <p>I still remember the day I first knew of you—it’s etched in my memory like sunlight carving its way into the heart of winter. If only you knew how much of my heart you carry with you. It’s in your company that I feel bright, alive, and new. You’re the color on my canvas, the light that makes shadows retreat, the certainty that clears my doubts. Without you, life would be dull and incomplete.</p>
        <p>You were my favorite (and slightly annoying) co-passenger, making every journey unforgettable. From the moments of laughter that left us breathless to the times you tested my patience as if it were your life’s mission—you’ve made it all worth remembering.</p>
        <p>Our induction days were filled with confusion—confusion about what I was feeling for you. But I’ll always be proud of myself for asking you directly that day (LOL). If I hadn’t, I’d regret not discovering the side of you I know today: a heart so pure and childlike, just like mine.</p>
        <p>I want to protect you from the world’s harshness, yet I know I sometimes turn into the one who unintentionally hurts you. I’m sorry for that. I wasn’t like this before, and I’m trying my best to be better, to heal from the things that shaped my fears.</p>
        <p>Thank you, Sarthak, for everything. For the way you listen, even when you’re exhausted from your own day. For holding my hand when I need it most. For your patience, your kindness, and your little acts of care.</p>
        <p>You’re not just my other half, Sarthak. You’re my pulse, my heartbeat, my everything. In Irish, I’d call you <i>mo chuisle, mo chroi</i>—my pulse, my heart. You’re in my tea each morning, our playlist each night, and every scene I witness. I can’t imagine a life without you.</p>
        <p>My New Year wish is that we achieve all our dreams and continue to grow, both as individuals and together. Here’s to another year of your terrible jokes, my dramatic eye rolls, and the beautiful chaos we create together. Let’s make 2024 even more unforgettable.</p>
        <p>I’ll always love you, Sarthak Bisht.</p>
        <p>(One-sided love story that will never end.)</p>
        <p>Forever yours,</p>
